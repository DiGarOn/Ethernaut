}
```

Solution:

1) `await contract.contribute({value:100, from:"<address>"})`
2) Send some ether to the contract 
3) `await contract.withdraw()` 
4) submit

You know the basics of how ether goes in and out of contracts, including the usage of the fallback method.

You've also learnt about OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract, and how it can be used to restrict the usage of some methods to a privileged address.
